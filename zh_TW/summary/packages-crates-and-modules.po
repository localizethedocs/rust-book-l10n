"As you write large programs, organizing your code will become increasingly "
"important. By grouping related functionality and separating code with "
"distinct features, you’ll clarify where to find code that implements a "
"particular feature and where to go to change how a feature works."

"The programs we’ve written so far have been in one module in one file. As a "
"project grows, you should organize code by splitting it into multiple "
"modules and then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary "
"crates and optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract "
"parts into separate crates that become external dependencies. This chapter "
"covers all these techniques. For very large projects comprising a set of "
"interrelated packages that evolve together, Cargo provides workspaces, which "
"we’ll cover in [“Cargo Workspaces”](ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)<!-- "
"ignore --> in Chapter 14."

"We’ll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you "
"reuse code at a higher level: Once you’ve implemented an operation, other "
"code can call your code via its public interface without having to know how "
"the implementation works. The way you write code defines which parts are "
"public for other code to use and which parts are private implementation "
"details that you reserve the right to change. This is another way to limit "
"the amount of detail you have to keep in your head."

"A related concept is scope: The nested context in which code is written has "
"a set of names that are defined as “in scope.” When reading, writing, and "
"compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular "
"name at a particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, "
"module, constant, or other item and what that item means. You can create "
"scopes and change which names are in or out of scope. You can’t have two "
"items with the same name in the same scope; tools are available to resolve "
"name conflicts."

"Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s "
