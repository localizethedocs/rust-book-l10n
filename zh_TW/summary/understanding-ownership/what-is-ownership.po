"_Ownership_ is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory. "
"All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while "
"running. Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-"
"longer-used memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer "
"must explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: "
"Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the "
"compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program won’t "
"compile. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while "
"it’s running."

"Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some "
"time to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become "
"with Rust and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it "
"to naturally develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!"

msgid ""
"Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and "
"the heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, "
"whether a value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves "
"and why you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be "
"described in relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so "
"here is a brief explanation in preparation."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.md:31
msgid ""
"Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to "
"use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores "
"values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite "
"order. This is referred to as _last in, first out (LIFO)_. Think of a stack "
"of plates: When you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and "
"when you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates "
"from the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called "
"_pushing onto the stack_, and removing data is called _popping off the "
"stack_. All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data "
"with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be "
"stored on the heap instead."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.md:43
msgid ""
"The heap is less organized: When you put data on the heap, you request a "
"certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the "
"heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a _pointer_, "
"which is the address of that location. This process is called _allocating on "
"the heap_ and is sometimes abbreviated as just _allocating_ (pushing values "
"onto the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the "
"heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but "
"when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being "
"seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in "
"your group, and the host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads "
"you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve "
"been seated to find you."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.md:56
msgid ""
"Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the "
"allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location "
"is always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the "
"heap requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough "
"space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next "
"allocation."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.md:63
msgid ""
"Accessing data in the heap is generally slower than accessing data on the "
"stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary "
"processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the "
"analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. "
"It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to "
"the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, "
"then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower "
"process. By the same token, a processor can usually do its job better if it "
"works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than "
"farther away (as it can be on the heap)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function "
"(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s "
"local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those "
"values get popped off the stack."

"Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, "
"minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused "
"data on the heap so that you don’t run out of space are all problems that "
"ownership addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think "
"about the stack and the heap very often. But knowing that the main purpose "
"of ownership is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it "
