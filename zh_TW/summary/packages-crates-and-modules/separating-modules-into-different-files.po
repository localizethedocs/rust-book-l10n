"For example, let’s start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple "
"restaurant modules. We’ll extract modules into files instead of having all "
"the modules defined in the crate root file. In this case, the crate root "
"file is _src/lib.rs_, but this procedure also works with binary crates whose "
"crate root file is _src/main.rs_."

"Rust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules "
"so that you can refer to items defined in one module from another module. "
"You can do this by specifying absolute or relative paths. These paths can be "
"brought into scope with a `use` statement so that you can use a shorter path "
"for multiple uses of the item in that scope. Module code is private by "
"default, but you can make definitions public by adding the `pub` keyword."
