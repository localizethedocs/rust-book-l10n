"Welcome to _The Rust Programming Language_, an introductory book about Rust. "
"The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable "
"software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in "
"programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through "
"balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust "
"gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) "
"without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control."

"Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams "
"of developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-"
"level code is prone to various subtle bugs, which in most other languages "
"can only be caught through extensive testing and careful code review by "
"experienced developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by "
"refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency "
"bugs. By working alongside the compiler, the team can spend its time "
"focusing on the program’s logic rather than chasing down bugs."

"Rust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language. By speed, we "
"mean both how quickly Rust code can run and the speed at which Rust lets you "
"write programs. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability through feature "
"additions and refactoring. This is in contrast to the brittle legacy code in "
"languages without these checks, which developers are often afraid to modify. "
"By striving for zero-cost abstractions—higher-level features that compile to "
"lower-level code as fast as code written manually—Rust endeavors to make "
"safe code be fast code as well."

"the rest are concept chapters."

"**Chapter 1** explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!” "
"program, and how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool. "
"**Chapter 2** is a hands-on introduction to writing a program in Rust, "
"having you build up a number-guessing game. Here, we cover concepts at a "
"high level, and later chapters will provide additional detail. If you want "
"to get your hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is the place for that. If "
"you’re a particularly meticulous learner who prefers to learn every detail "
"before moving on to the next, you might want to skip Chapter 2 and go "
"straight to **Chapter 3**, which covers Rust features that are similar to "
"those of other programming languages; then, you can return to Chapter 2 when "
"you’d like to work on a project applying the details you’ve learned."

"ensure that your program’s logic is correct. In **Chapter 12**, we’ll build "
"our own implementation of a subset of functionality from the `grep` command "

"the concepts we discussed in the previous chapters."
