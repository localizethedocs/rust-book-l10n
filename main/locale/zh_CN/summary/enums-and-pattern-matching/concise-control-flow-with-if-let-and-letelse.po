"The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way "
"to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider "
"the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an `Option<u8>` value in the "
"`config_max` variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the "
"`Some` variant."

"If the value is `Some`, we print out the value in the `Some` variant by "
"binding the value to the variable `max` in the pattern. We don’t want to do "

"to add `_ => ()` after processing just one variant, which is annoying "
"boilerplate code to add."

"The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal "
"sign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to "
"the `match` and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is "
"`Some(max)`, and the `max` binds to the value inside the `Some`. We can then "
"use `max` in the body of the `if let` block in the same way we used `max` in "
"the corresponding `match` arm. The code in the `if let` block only runs if "
"the value matches the pattern."

"Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate "
"code. However, you lose the exhaustive checking `match` enforces that "
"ensures that you aren’t forgetting to handle any cases. Choosing between "

"situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for "
"losing exhaustive checking."
