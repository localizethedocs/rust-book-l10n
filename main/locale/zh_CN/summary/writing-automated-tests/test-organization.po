"As mentioned at the start of the chapter, testing is a complex discipline, "
"and different people use different terminology and organization. The Rust "
"community thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and "
"integration tests. _Unit tests_ are small and more focused, testing one "
"module in isolation at a time, and can test private interfaces. _Integration "
"tests_ are entirely external to your library and use your code in the same "
"way any other external code would, using only the public interface and "
"potentially exercising multiple modules per test."

"The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the "

"expected. You’ll put unit tests in the _src_ directory in each file with the "
"code that they’re testing. The convention is to create a module named "
"`tests` in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the "
