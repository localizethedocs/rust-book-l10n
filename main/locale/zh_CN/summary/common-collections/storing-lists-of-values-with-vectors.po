"The first collection type we’ll look at is `Vec<T>`, also known as a vector. "
"Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure "
"that puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only "
"store values of the same type. They are useful when you have a list of "
"items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a "
"shopping cart."

"Note that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting any "
"values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend "
"to store. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using "
"generics; we’ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. "
"For now, know that the `Vec<T>` type provided by the standard library can "
"hold any type. When we create a vector to hold a specific type, we can "
"specify the type within angle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we’ve told Rust that "
"the `Vec<T>` in `v` will hold elements of the `i32` type."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch08-01-vectors.md:33
msgid ""
"More often, you’ll create a `Vec<T>` with initial values, and Rust will "
"infer the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this "
"type annotation. Rust conveniently provides the `vec!` macro, which will "
"create a new vector that holds the values you give it. Listing 8-2 creates a "
"new `Vec<i32>` that holds the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The integer type is "
"`i32` because that’s the default integer type, as we discussed in the [“Data "

"Note a few details here. We use the index value of `2` to get the third "

"and `[]` gives us a reference to the element at the index value. When we use "

"Rust provides these two ways to reference an element so that you can choose "
"how the program behaves when you try to use an index value outside the range "
"of existing elements. As an example, let’s see what happens when we have a "
"vector of five elements and then we try to access an element at index 100 "
"with each technique, as shown in Listing 8-5."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch08-01-vectors.md:133

"When we run this code, the first `[]` method will cause the program to panic "
"because it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when "
"you want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an element "
"past the end of the vector."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch08-01-vectors.md:138

"When the `get` method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it "
"returns `None` without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an "
"element beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal "
"circumstances. Your code will then have logic to handle having either "
"`Some(&element)` or `None`, as discussed in Chapter 6. For example, the "
"index could be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally "
"enter a number that’s too large and the program gets a `None` value, you "
"could tell the user how many items are in the current vector and give them "
"another chance to enter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than "
"crashing the program due to a typo!"

"references in the same scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where we "

"an element to the end. This program won’t work if we also try to refer to "

"The code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: Why should a "

"This error is due to the way vectors work: Because vectors put the values "
"next to each other in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the "
"vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to "
"the new space, if there isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to "
