"We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. "
"Here’s how it works: The program will generate a random integer between 1 "
"and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is "
"entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. "
"If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and "
"exit."

"This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: "
"`let`, `match`, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next "
"few chapters, you’ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3 "
"covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, "
"data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 "
"explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other "
"languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 "
