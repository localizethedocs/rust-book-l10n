"As we saw in [Chapter 16](http://localhost:3000/ch16-00-concurrency."
"html)<!-- ignore -->, threads provide one approach to concurrency. We’ve "
"seen another approach in this chapter: using async with futures and streams. "
"If you’re wondering when to choose one method over the other, the answer is: "
"it depends! And in many cases, the choice isn’t threads _or_ async but "
"rather threads _and_ async."

"Many operating systems have supplied threading-based concurrency models for "
"decades now, and many programming languages support them as a result. "
"However, these models are not without their tradeoffs. On many operating "
"systems, they use a fair bit of memory for each thread. Threads are also "
"only an option when your operating system and hardware support them. Unlike "
"mainstream desktop and mobile computers, some embedded systems don’t have an "
"OS at all, so they also don’t have threads."

"The async model provides a different—and ultimately complementary—set of "
"tradeoffs. In the async model, concurrent operations don’t require their own "
"threads. Instead, they can run on tasks, as when we used `trpl::spawn_task` "
"to kick off work from a synchronous function in the streams section. A task "
"is similar to a thread, but instead of being managed by the operating "
"system, it’s managed by library-level code: the runtime."

"There’s a reason the APIs for spawning threads and spawning tasks are so "
"similar. Threads act as a boundary for sets of synchronous operations; "
"concurrency is possible _between_ threads. Tasks act as a boundary for sets "
"of _asynchronous_ operations; concurrency is possible both _between_ and "
"_within_ tasks, because a task can switch between futures in its body. "
"Finally, futures are Rust’s most granular unit of concurrency, and each "
"future may represent a tree of other futures. The runtime—specifically, its "
"executor—manages tasks, and tasks manage futures. In that regard, tasks are "
"similar to lightweight, runtime-managed threads with added capabilities that "
"come from being managed by a runtime instead of by the operating system."

"This doesn’t mean that async tasks are always better than threads (or vice "
"versa). Concurrency with threads is in some ways a simpler programming model "
"than concurrency with `async`. That can be a strength or a weakness. Threads "
"are somewhat “fire and forget”; they have no native equivalent to a future, "
"so they simply run to completion without being interrupted except by the "
"operating system itself."

"And it turns out that threads and tasks often work very well together, "
"because tasks can (at least in some runtimes) be moved around between "
"threads. In fact, under the hood, the runtime we’ve been using—including the "
"`spawn_blocking` and `spawn_task` functions—is multithreaded by default! "
"Many runtimes use an approach called _work stealing_ to transparently move "
"tasks around between threads, based on how the threads are currently being "
"utilized, to improve the system’s overall performance. That approach "
"actually requires threads _and_ tasks, and therefore futures."

"If the work is _very parallelizable_ (that is, CPU-bound), such as "

"And if you need both parallelism and concurrency, you don’t have to choose "

"We begin by creating an async channel, then spawning a thread that takes "
