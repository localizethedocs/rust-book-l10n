"In Rust, _release profiles_ are predefined, customizable profiles with "
"different configurations that allow a programmer to have more control over "
"various options for compiling code. Each profile is configured independently "
"of the others."

"Cargo has two main profiles: the `dev` profile Cargo uses when you run "
"`cargo build`, and the `release` profile Cargo uses when you run `cargo "
"build --release`. The `dev` profile is defined with good defaults for "
"development, and the `release` profile has good defaults for release builds."

"The `opt-level` setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply "
"to your code, with a range of 0 to 3. Applying more optimizations extends "
"compiling time, so if you’re in development and compiling your code often, "
"you’ll want fewer optimizations to compile faster even if the resultant code "
"runs slower. The default `opt-level` for `dev` is therefore `0`. When you’re "
"ready to release your code, it’s best to spend more time compiling. You’ll "
"only compile in release mode once, but you’ll run the compiled program many "
"times, so release mode trades longer compile time for code that runs faster. "
"That is why the default `opt-level` for the `release` profile is `3`."

"You can override a default setting by adding a different value for it in "

"This code overrides the default setting of `0`. Now when we run `cargo "
"build`, Cargo will use the defaults for the `dev` profile plus our "

"apply more optimizations than the default, but not as many as in a release "
"build."
