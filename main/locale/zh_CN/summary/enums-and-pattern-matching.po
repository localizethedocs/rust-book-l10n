"In this chapter, we’ll look at enumerations, also referred to as _enums_. "
"Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. First "
"we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along "
"with data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called `Option`, "
"which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then, we’ll "
"look at how pattern matching in the `match` expression makes it easy to run "
"different code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the "
"`if let` construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to "
"handle enums in your code."
