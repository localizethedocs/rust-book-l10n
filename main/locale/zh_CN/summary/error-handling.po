"Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for "
"handling situations in which something goes wrong. In many cases, Rust "
"requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action "
"before your code will compile. This requirement makes your program more "
"robust by ensuring that you’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately "
"before deploying your code to production!"

"Rust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable "
"errors. For a _recoverable error_, such as a _file not found_ error, we most "
"likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation. "
"_Unrecoverable errors_ are always symptoms of bugs, such as trying to access "
"a location beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop "
"the program."

"Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and "
"handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust "
"doesn’t have exceptions. Instead, it has the type `Result<T, E>` for "
"recoverable errors and the `panic!` macro that stops execution when the "
"program encounters an unrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling "
"`panic!` first and then talks about returning `Result<T, E>` values. "
"Additionally, we’ll explore considerations when deciding whether to try to "
"recover from an error or to stop execution."
