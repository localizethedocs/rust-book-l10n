"The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler. "
"Rust’s stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that "
"compile will continue to compile with newer Rust versions. The output might "
"differ slightly between versions because Rust often improves error messages "
"and warnings. In other words, any newer, stable version of Rust you install "
"using these steps should work as expected with the content of this book."
