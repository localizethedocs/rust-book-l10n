msgid ""
"A _struct_, or _structure_, is a custom data type that lets you package "
"together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. "
"If you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an "
"object’s data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples "
"with structs to build on what you already know and demonstrate when structs "
"are a better way to group data."

msgid ""
"We’ll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We’ll discuss how "
"to define associated functions, especially the kind of associated functions "
"called _methods_, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs "
"and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new "
"types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile-time "
"type checking."
