"There is no consensus in the programming community about what features a "
"language must have to be considered object oriented. Rust is influenced by "
"many programming paradigms, including OOP; for example, we explored the "
"features that came from functional programming in Chapter 13. Arguably, OOP "
"languages share certain common characteristics—namely, objects, "
"encapsulation, and inheritance. Let’s look at what each of those "
"characteristics means and whether Rust supports it."

"The book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_ by "
"Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (Addison-"
"Wesley, 1994), colloquially referred to as _The Gang of Four_ book, is a "

"Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An **object** packages both "
"data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are "
"typically called **methods** or **operations**."

"Using this definition, Rust is object oriented: Structs and enums have data, "
"and `impl` blocks provide methods on structs and enums. Even though structs "
"and enums with methods aren’t _called_ objects, they provide the same "
"functionality, according to the Gang of Four’s definition of objects."

"Another aspect commonly associated with OOP is the idea of _encapsulation_, "
"which means that the implementation details of an object aren’t accessible "
"to code using that object. Therefore, the only way to interact with an "
"object is through its public API; code using the object shouldn’t be able to "
"reach into the object’s internals and change data or behavior directly. This "
"enables the programmer to change and refactor an object’s internals without "
"needing to change the code that uses the object."

"We discussed how to control encapsulation in Chapter 7: We can use the `pub` "
"keyword to decide which modules, types, functions, and methods in our code "
"should be public, and by default everything else is private. For example, we "
"can define a struct `AveragedCollection` that has a field containing a "
"vector of `i32` values. The struct can also have a field that contains the "
"average of the values in the vector, meaning the average doesn’t have to be "
"computed on demand whenever anyone needs it. In other words, "
"`AveragedCollection` will cache the calculated average for us. Listing 18-1 "
"has the definition of the `AveragedCollection` struct."

#: src/ch18-01-what-is-oo.md:58

"The struct is marked `pub` so that other code can use it, but the fields "
"within the struct remain private. This is important in this case because we "
"want to ensure that whenever a value is added or removed from the list, the "
"average is also updated. We do this by implementing `add`, `remove`, and "
"`average` methods on the struct, as shown in Listing 18-2."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch18-01-what-is-oo.md:102
msgid ""
"The public methods `add`, `remove`, and `average` are the only ways to "
"access or modify data in an instance of `AveragedCollection`. When an item "
"is added to `list` using the `add` method or removed using the `remove` "
"method, the implementations of each call the private `update_average` method "
"that handles updating the `average` field as well."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch18-01-what-is-oo.md:108
msgid ""
"We leave the `list` and `average` fields private so that there is no way for "
"external code to add or remove items to or from the `list` field directly; "
"otherwise, the `average` field might become out of sync when the `list` "
"changes. The `average` method returns the value in the `average` field, "
"allowing external code to read the `average` but not modify it."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch18-01-what-is-oo.md:114
msgid ""
"Because we’ve encapsulated the implementation details of the struct "
"`AveragedCollection`, we can easily change aspects, such as the data "
"structure, in the future. For instance, we could use a `HashSet<i32>` "
"instead of a `Vec<i32>` for the `list` field. As long as the signatures of "
"the `add`, `remove`, and `average` public methods stayed the same, code "
"using `AveragedCollection` wouldn’t need to change. If we made `list` public "
"instead, this wouldn’t necessarily be the case: `HashSet<i32>` and "
"`Vec<i32>` have different methods for adding and removing items, so the "
"external code would likely have to change if it were modifying `list` "
"directly."

"_Inheritance_ is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from "

"However, if you’re used to having inheritance in your programming toolbox, "

"You would choose inheritance for two main reasons. One is for reuse of code: "
"You can implement particular behavior for one type, and inheritance enables "
"you to reuse that implementation for a different type. You can do this in a "
"limited way in Rust code using default trait method implementations, which "
"you saw in Listing 10-14 when we added a default implementation of the "
"`summarize` method on the `Summary` trait. Any type implementing the "
"`Summary` trait would have the `summarize` method available on it without "
"any further code. This is similar to a parent class having an implementation "
"of a method and an inheriting child class also having the implementation of "
"the method. We can also override the default implementation of the "
"`summarize` method when we implement the `Summary` trait, which is similar "
"to a child class overriding the implementation of a method inherited from a "
"parent class."

"The other reason to use inheritance relates to the type system: to enable a "
"child type to be used in the same places as the parent type. This is also "
"called _polymorphism_, which means that you can substitute multiple objects "

"To many people, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance. But it’s "

"Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and "

"Rust has chosen a different set of trade-offs by not offering inheritance. "
"Inheritance is often at risk of sharing more code than necessary. Subclasses "
"shouldn’t always share all characteristics of their parent class but will do "
"so with inheritance. This can make a program’s design less flexible. It also "
"introduces the possibility of calling methods on subclasses that don’t make "
"sense or that cause errors because the methods don’t apply to the subclass. "
"In addition, some languages will only allow _single inheritance_ (meaning a "
"subclass can only inherit from one class), further restricting the "
"flexibility of a program’s design."
