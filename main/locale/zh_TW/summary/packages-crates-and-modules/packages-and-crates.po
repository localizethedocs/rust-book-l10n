"A _crate_ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at "
"a time. Even if you run `rustc` rather than `cargo` and pass a single source "
"code file (as we did all the way back in [“Rust Program Basics”](ch01-02-"
"hello-world.html#rust-program-basics)<!-- ignore\n"
"--> in Chapter 1), the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates "
"can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get "
"compiled with the crate, as we’ll see in the coming sections."

"A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate. "
"_Binary crates_ are programs you can compile to an executable that you can "
"run, such as a command line program or a server. Each must have a function "
"called `main` that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the "
"crates we’ve created so far have been binary crates."

"_Library crates_ don’t have a `main` function, and they don’t compile to an "
"executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with "
"multiple projects. For example, the `rand` crate we used in [Chapter 2]"
"(ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number)<!-- ignore "
"--> provides functionality that generates random numbers. Most of the time "
"when Rustaceans say “crate,” they mean library crate, and they use “crate” "
"interchangeably with the general programming concept of a “library.”"

"A _package_ is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of "
"functionality. A package contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describes how to "
"build those crates. Cargo is actually a package that contains the binary "
"crate for the command line tool you’ve been using to build your code. The "
"Cargo package also contains a library crate that the binary crate depends "
"on. Other projects can depend on the Cargo library crate to use the same "
"logic the Cargo command line tool uses."

"After we run `cargo new my-project`, we use `ls` to see what Cargo creates. "

"toml_ in your text editor and note that there’s no mention of _src/main.rs_. "
"Cargo follows a convention that _src/main.rs_ is the crate root of a binary "
"crate with the same name as the package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the "
"package directory contains _src/lib.rs_, the package contains a library "
"crate with the same name as the package, and _src/lib.rs_ is its crate root. "
"Cargo passes the crate root files to `rustc` to build the library or binary."

"Here, we have a package that only contains _src/main.rs_, meaning it only "

"rs_ and _src/lib.rs_, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with "
"the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by "
"placing files in the _src/bin_ directory: Each file will be a separate "
"binary crate."
