"The Rust programming language has come a long way in a few short years, from "
"its creation and incubation by a small and nascent community of enthusiasts, "
"to becoming one of the most loved and in-demand programming languages in the "
"world. Looking back, it was inevitable that the power and promise of Rust "
"would turn heads and gain a foothold in systems programming. What was not "
"inevitable was the global growth in interest and innovation that permeated "
"through open source communities and catalyzed wide-scale adoption across "
"industries."

"At this point in time, it is easy to point to the wonderful features that "
"Rust has to offer to explain this explosion in interest and adoption. Who "
"doesn’t want memory safety, _and_ fast performance, _and_ a friendly "
"compiler, _and_ great tooling, among a host of other wonderful features? The "
"Rust language you see today combines years of research in systems "
"programming with the practical wisdom of a vibrant and passionate community. "
"This language was designed with purpose and crafted with care, offering "
"developers a tool that makes it easier to write safe, fast, and reliable "
"code."

"But what makes Rust truly special is its roots in empowering you, the user, "
"to achieve your goals. This is a language that wants you to succeed, and the "
"principle of empowerment runs through the core of the community that builds, "
"maintains, and advocates for this language. Since the previous edition of "
"this definitive text, Rust has further developed into a truly global and "
"trusted language. The Rust Project is now robustly supported by the Rust "
"Foundation, which also invests in key initiatives to ensure that Rust is "
"secure, stable, and sustainable."

"The Rust journey has been one of collaboration, learning, and iteration. The "
"growth of the language and its ecosystem is a direct reflection of the "
"vibrant, diverse community behind it. The contributions of thousands of "
"developers, from core language designers to casual contributors, are what "
"make Rust such a unique and powerful tool. By picking up this book, you’re "
"not just learning a new programming language—you’re joining a movement to "
"make software better, safer, and more enjoyable to work with."
