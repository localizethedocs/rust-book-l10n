"Every programming language has tools for effectively handling the "
"duplication of concepts. In Rust, one such tool is _generics_: abstract "
"stand-ins for concrete types or other properties. We can express the "
"behavior of generics or how they relate to other generics without knowing "
"what will be in their place when compiling and running the code."

"Functions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a concrete "
"type like `i32` or `String`, in the same way they take parameters with "
"unknown values to run the same code on multiple concrete values. In fact, we "
"already used generics in Chapter 6 with `Option<T>`, in Chapter 8 with "
"`Vec<T>` and `HashMap<K, V>`, and in Chapter 9 with `Result<T, E>`. In this "
"chapter, you’ll explore how to define your own types, functions, and methods "
"with generics!"

"First, we’ll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication. "
"We’ll then use the same technique to make a generic function from two "
"functions that differ only in the types of their parameters. We’ll also "
"explain how to use generic types in struct and enum definitions."

"Then, you’ll learn how to use traits to define behavior in a generic way. "
"You can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to "
"accept only those types that have a particular behavior, as opposed to just "
"any type."

"Finally, we’ll discuss _lifetimes_: a variety of generics that give the "
"compiler information about how references relate to each other. Lifetimes "
"allow us to give the compiler enough information about borrowed values so "
"that it can ensure that references will be valid in more situations than it "
"could without our help."

"Generics allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder that "
"represents multiple types to remove code duplication. Before diving into "
"generics syntax, let’s first look at how to remove duplication in a way that "
"doesn’t involve generic types by extracting a function that replaces "
"specific values with a placeholder that represents multiple values. Then, "
"we’ll apply the same technique to extract a generic function! By looking at "
"how to recognize duplicated code you can extract into a function, you’ll "
"start to recognize duplicated code that can use generics."

"We store a list of integers in the variable `number_list` and place a "

"largest number seen so far, the variable doesn’t change, and the code moves "
