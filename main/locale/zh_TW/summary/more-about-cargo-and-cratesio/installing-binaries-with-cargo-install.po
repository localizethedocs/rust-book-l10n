"The `cargo install` command allows you to install and use binary crates "
"locally. This isn’t intended to replace system packages; it’s meant to be a "
"convenient way for Rust developers to install tools that others have shared "
"on [crates.io](https://crates.io/)<!-- ignore -->. Note that you can only "
"install packages that have binary targets. A _binary target_ is the runnable "
"program that is created if the crate has a _src/main.rs_ file or another "
"file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isn’t "
"runnable on its own but is suitable for including within other programs. "
"Usually, crates have information in the README file about whether a crate is "
"a library, has a binary target, or both."

"All binaries installed with `cargo install` are stored in the installation "
"root’s _bin_ folder. If you installed Rust using _rustup.rs_ and don’t have "
"any custom configurations, this directory will be _$HOME/.cargo/bin_. Ensure "
"that this directory is in your `$PATH` to be able to run programs you’ve "
"installed with `cargo install`."

"For example, in Chapter 12 we mentioned that there’s a Rust implementation "
"of the `grep` tool called `ripgrep` for searching files. To install "
"`ripgrep`, we can run the following:"

"The second-to-last line of the output shows the location and the name of the "
"installed binary, which in the case of `ripgrep` is `rg`. As long as the "
"installation directory is in your `$PATH`, as mentioned previously, you can "
"then run `rg --help` and start using a faster, Rustier tool for searching "
"files!"
