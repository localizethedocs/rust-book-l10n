"A _workspace_ is a set of packages that share the same _Cargo.lock_ and "

"multiple ways to structure a workspace, so we'll just show one common way. "
"We’ll have a workspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, "
"which will provide the main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. "
"One library will provide an `add_one` function and the other library an "
"`add_two` function. These three crates will be part of the same workspace. "
