"Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the "
"rest of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees "
"without needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how "
"ownership works. In this chapter, we’ll talk about ownership as well as "
"several related features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in "
"memory."
