"This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming "
"language and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in "
"common at their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are "
"unique to Rust, but we’ll discuss them in the context of Rust and explain "
"the conventions around using them."

"Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, "
"comments, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, "
"and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from."

"The Rust language has a set of _keywords_ that are reserved for use by the "
"language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use "
"these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have "
"special meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust "
"programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have "
"been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. "
"You can find the list of the keywords in [Appendix A](appendix-01-keywords."
