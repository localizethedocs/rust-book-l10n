"Rust’s design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and "
"techniques, and one significant influence is _functional programming_. "
"Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values "
"by passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning "
"them to variables for later execution, and so forth."

"In this chapter, we won’t debate the issue of what functional programming is "
"or isn’t but will instead discuss some features of Rust that are similar to "
"features in many languages often referred to as functional."
