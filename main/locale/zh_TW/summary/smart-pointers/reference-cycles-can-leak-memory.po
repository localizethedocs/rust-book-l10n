"Rust’s memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to "
"accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a _memory "
"leak_). Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust’s guarantees, "
"meaning memory leaks are memory safe in Rust. We can see that Rust allows "
"memory leaks by using `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`: It’s possible to create "
"references where items refer to each other in a cycle. This creates memory "
"leaks because the reference count of each item in the cycle will never reach "
"0, and the values will never be dropped."
