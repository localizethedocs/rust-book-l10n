"The `incoming` method on `TcpListener` returns an iterator that gives us a "

"single _stream_ represents an open connection between the client and the "

"and the server closes the connection. As such, we will read from the "
"`TcpStream` to see what the client sent and then write our response to the "

"At the moment, the `if` and `else` blocks have a lot of repetition: They’re "
"both reading files and writing the contents of the files to the stream. The "
"only differences are the status line and the filename. Let’s make the code "
"more concise by pulling out those differences into separate `if` and `else` "
"lines that will assign the values of the status line and the filename to "
"variables; we can then use those variables unconditionally in the code to "
"read the file and write the response. Listing 21-9 shows the resultant code "
"after replacing the large `if` and `else` blocks."

"Now the `if` and `else` blocks only return the appropriate values for the "

"The previously duplicated code is now outside the `if` and `else` blocks and "

"the difference between the two cases, and it means we have only one place to "

"writing work. The behavior of the code in Listing 21-9 will be the same as "
