"This chapter is a recap of the many skills you’ve learned so far and an "
"exploration of a few more standard library features. We’ll build a command "
"line tool that interacts with file and command line input/output to practice "
"some of the Rust concepts you now have under your belt."

"Rust’s speed, safety, single binary output, and cross-platform support make "
"it an ideal language for creating command line tools, so for our project, "
"we’ll make our own version of the classic command line search tool `grep` "
"(**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint). In the "
"simplest use case, `grep` searches a specified file for a specified string. "
"To do so, `grep` takes as its arguments a file path and a string. Then, it "
"reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, "
"and prints those lines."

"Along the way, we’ll show how to make our command line tool use the terminal "
"features that many other command line tools use. We’ll read the value of an "
"environment variable to allow the user to configure the behavior of our "
"tool. We’ll also print error messages to the standard error console stream "
"(`stderr`) instead of standard output (`stdout`) so that, for example, the "
"user can redirect successful output to a file while still seeing error "
"messages onscreen."

"One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully "
"featured, very fast version of `grep`, called `ripgrep`. By comparison, our "
"version will be fairly simple, but this chapter will give you some of the "
"background knowledge you need to understand a real-world project such as "
"`ripgrep`."
