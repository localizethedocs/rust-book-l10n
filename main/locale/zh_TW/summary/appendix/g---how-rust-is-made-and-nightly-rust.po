"As a language, Rust cares a _lot_ about the stability of your code. We want "
"Rust to be a rock-solid foundation you can build on, and if things were "
"constantly changing, that would be impossible. At the same time, if we can’t "
"experiment with new features, we may not find out important flaws until "
"after their release, when we can no longer change things."

"Our solution to this problem is what we call “stability without stagnation”, "
"and our guiding principle is this: you should never have to fear upgrading "
"to a new version of stable Rust. Each upgrade should be painless, but should "

"release happened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with realistic "
"version numbers. A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit lands on the "
"main branch. Each night, a new nightly version of Rust is produced. Every "
"day is a release day, and these releases are created by our release "
"infrastructure automatically. So as time passes, our releases look like "

"Let’s say a regression is found. Good thing we had some time to test the "

"Hooray! Rust 1.5 is done! However, we’ve forgotten one thing: because the "
"six weeks have gone by, we also need a new beta of the _next_ version of "

"`beta` branches off of `nightly` again:"

"This is called the “train model” because every six weeks, a release “leaves "

msgid ""
"Rust releases every six weeks, like clockwork. If you know the date of one "
"Rust release, you can know the date of the next one: it’s six weeks later. A "
"nice aspect of having releases scheduled every six weeks is that the next "
"train is coming soon. If a feature happens to miss a particular release, "
"there’s no need to worry: another one is happening in a short time! This "
"helps reduce pressure to sneak possibly unpolished features in close to the "
"release deadline."

"Thanks to this process, you can always check out the next build of Rust and "
"verify for yourself that it’s easy to upgrade to: if a beta release doesn’t "
"work as expected, you can report it to the team and get it fixed before the "
"next stable release happens! Breakage in a beta release is relatively rare, "
"but `rustc` is still a piece of software, and bugs do exist."

msgid ""
"There’s one more catch with this release model: unstable features. Rust uses "
"a technique called “feature flags” to determine what features are enabled in "
"a given release. If a new feature is under active development, it lands on "
"the main branch, and therefore, in nightly, but behind a _feature flag_. If "
"you, as a user, wish to try out the work-in-progress feature, you can, but "
"you must be using a nightly release of Rust and annotate your source code "
"with the appropriate flag to opt in."
msgstr ""

#: src/appendix-07-nightly-rust.md:133
msgid ""
"If you’re using a beta or stable release of Rust, you can’t use any feature "
"flags. This is the key that allows us to get practical use with new features "
"before we declare them stable forever. Those who wish to opt into the "
"bleeding edge can do so, and those who want a rock-solid experience can "
"stick with stable and know that their code won’t break. Stability without "
"stagnation."

"This book only contains information about stable features, as in-progress "

"As you can see, the stable toolchain is the default. Most Rust users use "
"stable most of the time. You might want to use stable most of the time, but "
"use nightly on a specific project, because you care about a cutting-edge "
"feature. To do so, you can use `rustup override` in that project’s directory "
