"Sometimes bad things happen in your code, and there’s nothing you can do "
"about it. In these cases, Rust has the `panic!` macro. There are two ways to "
"cause a panic in practice: by taking an action that causes our code to panic "
"(such as accessing an array past the end) or by explicitly calling the "
"`panic!` macro. In both cases, we cause a panic in our program. By default, "
"these panics will print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and "
"quit. Via an environment variable, you can also have Rust display the call "
"stack when a panic occurs to make it easier to track down the source of the "
"panic."

"By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts _unwinding_, which means "
"Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it "
"encounters. However, walking back and cleaning up is a lot of work. Rust "
"therefore allows you to choose the alternative of immediately _aborting_, "
"which ends the program without cleaning up."

"Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the "
"operating system. If in your project you need to make the resultant binary "
"as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic "
"by adding `panic = 'abort'` to the appropriate `[profile]` sections in your "
"_Cargo.toml_ file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release "
"mode, add this:"

"We can use the backtrace of the functions the `panic!` call came from to "
