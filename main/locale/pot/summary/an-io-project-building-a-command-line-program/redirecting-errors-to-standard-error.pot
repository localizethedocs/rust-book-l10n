"At the moment, we’re writing all of our output to the terminal using the "

"_standard output_ (`stdout`) for general information and _standard error_ "

"messages to the screen."

"First, let’s observe how the content printed by `minigrep` is currently "

"write to standard error instead. We’ll do that by redirecting the standard "

"We’ll use the code in Listing 12-24 to change how error messages are "

"code that prints error messages is in one function, `main`. The standard "
"library provides the `eprintln!` macro that prints to the standard error "
"stream, so let’s change the two places we were calling `println!` to print "
"errors to use `eprintln!` instead."

"This chapter recapped some of the major concepts you’ve learned so far and "
"covered how to perform common I/O operations in Rust. By using command line "
"arguments, files, environment variables, and the `eprintln!` macro for "
"printing errors, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. "
"Combined with the concepts in previous chapters, your code will be well "
"organized, store data effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle "
"errors nicely, and be well tested."
