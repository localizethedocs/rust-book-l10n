"Great! The code read and then printed the contents of the file. But the code "
"has a few flaws. At the moment, the `main` function has multiple "
"responsibilities: Generally, functions are clearer and easier to maintain if "
"each function is responsible for only one idea. The other problem is that "
"we’re not handling errors as well as we could. The program is still small, "
"so these flaws aren’t a big problem, but as the program grows, it will be "
"harder to fix them cleanly. It’s a good practice to begin refactoring early "
"on when developing a program because it’s much easier to refactor smaller "
"amounts of code. We’ll do that next."
