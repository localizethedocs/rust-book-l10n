"Before we get started, we should mention two details. First, the method "
"we’ll use won’t be the best way to build a web server with Rust. Community "
"members have published a number of production-ready crates available at "
"[crates.io](https://crates.io/) that provide more complete web server and "
"thread pool implementations than we’ll build. However, our intention in this "
"chapter is to help you learn, not to take the easy route. Because Rust is a "
"systems programming language, we can choose the level of abstraction we want "
"to work with and can go to a lower level than is possible or practical in "
"other languages."

"Second, we will not be using async and await here. Building a thread pool is "
"a big enough challenge on its own, without adding in building an async "
"runtime! However, we will note how async and await might be applicable to "
"some of the same problems we will see in this chapter. Ultimately, as we "
"noted back in Chapter 17, many async runtimes use thread pools for managing "
"their work."

"We’ll therefore write the basic HTTP server and thread pool manually so that "
"you can learn the general ideas and techniques behind the crates you might "
"use in the future."
