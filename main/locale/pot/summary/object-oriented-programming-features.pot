"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of modeling programs. Objects as "
"a programmatic concept were introduced in the programming language Simula in "
"the 1960s. Those objects influenced Alan Kay’s programming architecture in "
"which objects pass messages to each other. To describe this architecture, he "
"coined the term _object-oriented programming_ in 1967. Many competing "
"definitions describe what OOP is, and by some of these definitions Rust is "
"object oriented but by others it is not. In this chapter, we’ll explore "
"certain characteristics that are commonly considered object oriented and how "
"those characteristics translate to idiomatic Rust. We’ll then show you how "
"to implement an object-oriented design pattern in Rust and discuss the trade-"
"offs of doing so versus implementing a solution using some of Rust’s "
"strengths instead."
