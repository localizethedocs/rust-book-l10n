"Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. Patterns that will "
"match for any possible value passed are _irrefutable_. An example would be "
"`x` in the statement `let x = 5;` because `x` matches anything and therefore "
"cannot fail to match. Patterns that can fail to match for some possible "
"value are _refutable_. An example would be `Some(x)` in the expression `if "
"let Some(x) = a_value` because if the value in the `a_value` variable is "
"`None` rather than `Some`, the `Some(x)` pattern will not match."

"Function parameters, `let` statements, and `for` loops can only accept "
"irrefutable patterns because the program cannot do anything meaningful when "
"values don’t match. The `if let` and `while let` expressions and the `let..."
"else` statement accept refutable and irrefutable patterns, but the compiler "
"warns against irrefutable patterns because, by definition, they’re intended "
"to handle possible failure: The functionality of a conditional is in its "
"ability to perform differently depending on success or failure."

"In general, you shouldn’t have to worry about the distinction between "
"refutable and irrefutable patterns; however, you do need to be familiar with "
"the concept of refutability so that you can respond when you see it in an "
"error message. In those cases, you’ll need to change either the pattern or "
"the construct you’re using the pattern with, depending on the intended "
"behavior of the code."

"Let’s look at an example of what happens when we try to use a refutable "
"pattern where Rust requires an irrefutable pattern and vice versa. Listing "

"`Some(x)`, a refutable pattern. As you might expect, this code will not "

"valid the code can do with a `None` value. At compile time, Rust will "
