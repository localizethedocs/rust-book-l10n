"closure’s environment—into the `sort_operations` vector. The closure "
"captures `value` and then moves `value` out of the closure by transferring "
"ownership of `value` to the `sort_operations` vector. This closure can be "
"called once; trying to call it a second time wouldn’t work, because `value` "
"would no longer be in the environment to be pushed into `sort_operations` "
"again! Therefore, this closure only implements `FnOnce`. When we try to "
"compile this code, we get this error that `value` can’t be moved out of the "
"closure because the closure must implement `FnMut`:"

"The error points to the line in the closure body that moves `value` out of "
"the environment. To fix this, we need to change the closure body so that it "
"doesn’t move values out of the environment. Keeping a counter in the "
"environment and incrementing its value in the closure body is a more "
"straightforward way to count the number of times the closure is called. The "
"closure in Listing 13-9 works with `sort_by_key` because it is only "
"capturing a mutable reference to the `num_sort_operations` counter and can "
"therefore be called more than once."
