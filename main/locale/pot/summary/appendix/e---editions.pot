"The Rust language and compiler have a six-week release cycle, meaning users "
"get a constant stream of new features. Other programming languages release "
"larger changes less often; Rust releases smaller updates more frequently. "
"After a while, all of these tiny changes add up. But from release to "
"release, it can be difficult to look back and say, “Wow, between Rust 1.10 "
"and Rust 1.31, Rust has changed a lot!”"

"Every three years or so, the Rust team produces a new Rust _edition_. Each "
"edition brings together the features that have landed into a clear package "

"At the time of this writing, four Rust editions are available: Rust 2015, "

"The `edition` key in _Cargo.toml_ indicates which edition the compiler "
"should use for your code. If the key doesn’t exist, Rust uses `2015` as the "
"edition value for backward compatibility reasons."

"Each project can opt in to an edition other than the default 2015 edition. "
"Editions can contain incompatible changes, such as including a new keyword "
"that conflicts with identifiers in code. However, unless you opt in to those "
"changes, your code will continue to compile even as you upgrade the Rust "
"compiler version you use."

msgid ""
"All Rust compiler versions support any edition that existed prior to that "
"compiler’s release, and they can link crates of any supported editions "
"together. Edition changes only affect the way the compiler initially parses "
"code. Therefore, if you’re using Rust 2015 and one of your dependencies uses "
"Rust 2018, your project will compile and be able to use that dependency. The "
"opposite situation, where your project uses Rust 2018 and a dependency uses "
"Rust 2015, works as well."

"To be clear: Most features will be available on all editions. Developers "
"using any Rust edition will continue to see improvements as new stable "
"releases are made. However, in some cases, mainly when new keywords are "
"added, some new features might only be available in later editions. You will "
"need to switch editions if you want to take advantage of such features."
