"Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures "
"called _collections_. Most other data types represent one specific value, "
"but collections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and "
"tuple types, the data that these collections point to is stored on the heap, "
"which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and "
"can grow or shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has "
"different capabilities and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your "
"current situation is a skill you’ll develop over time. In this chapter, "
"we’ll discuss three collections that are used very often in Rust programs:"
