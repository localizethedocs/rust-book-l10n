"Cargo is designed so that you can extend it with new subcommands without "
"having to modify it. If a binary in your `$PATH` is named `cargo-something`, "
"you can run it as if it were a Cargo subcommand by running `cargo "
"something`. Custom commands like this are also listed when you run `cargo --"
"list`. Being able to use `cargo install` to install extensions and then run "
"them just like the built-in Cargo tools is a super-convenient benefit of "
"Cargo’s design!"
