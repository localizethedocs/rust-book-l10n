"By now, you’ve learned the most commonly used parts of the Rust programming "
"language. Before we do one more project, in Chapter 21, we’ll look at a few "
"aspects of the language you might run into every once in a while but may not "
"use every day. You can use this chapter as a reference for when you "
"encounter any unknowns. The features covered here are useful in very "
"specific situations. Although you might not reach for them often, we want to "
"make sure you have a grasp of all the features Rust has to offer."
