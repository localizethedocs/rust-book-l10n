"Patterns are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of "
"types, both complex and simple. Using patterns in conjunction with `match` "
"expressions and other constructs gives you more control over a program’s "
"control flow. A pattern consists of some combination of the following:"

"Some example patterns include `x`, `(a, 3)`, and `Some(Color::Red)`. In the "
"contexts in which patterns are valid, these components describe the shape of "
"data. Our program then matches values against the patterns to determine "
"whether it has the correct shape of data to continue running a particular "
"piece of code."

"To use a pattern, we compare it to some value. If the pattern matches the "
"value, we use the value parts in our code. Recall the `match` expressions in "
"Chapter 6 that used patterns, such as the coin-sorting machine example. If "
"the value fits the shape of the pattern, we can use the named pieces. If it "
"doesn’t, the code associated with the pattern won’t run."

"This chapter is a reference on all things related to patterns. We’ll cover "
"the valid places to use patterns, the difference between refutable and "
"irrefutable patterns, and the different kinds of pattern syntax that you "
"might see. By the end of the chapter, you’ll know how to use patterns to "
"express many concepts in a clear way."
