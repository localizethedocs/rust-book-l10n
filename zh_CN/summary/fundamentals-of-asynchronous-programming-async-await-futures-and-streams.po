"Many operations we ask the computer to do can take a while to finish. It "
"would be nice if we could do something else while we’re waiting for those "
"long-running processes to complete. Modern computers offer two techniques "
"for working on more than one operation at a time: parallelism and "
"concurrency. Our programs’ logic, however, is written in a mostly linear "
"fashion. We’d like to be able to specify the operations a program should "
"perform and points at which a function could pause and some other part of "
"the program could run instead, without needing to specify up front exactly "
"the order and manner in which each bit of code should run. _Asynchronous "
"programming_ is an abstraction that lets us express our code in terms of "
"potential pausing points and eventual results that takes care of the details "
"of coordination for us."

"This chapter builds on Chapter 16’s use of threads for parallelism and "
"concurrency by introducing an alternative approach to writing code: Rust’s "
"futures, streams, and the `async` and `await` syntax that let us express how "
"operations could be asynchronous, and the third-party crates that implement "
"asynchronous runtimes: code that manages and coordinates the execution of "
"asynchronous operations."

"Let’s consider an example. Say you’re exporting a video you’ve created of a "
"family celebration, an operation that could take anywhere from minutes to "
"hours. The video export will use as much CPU and GPU power as it can. If you "
"had only one CPU core and your operating system didn’t pause that export "
"until it completed—that is, if it executed the export _synchronously_—you "
"couldn’t do anything else on your computer while that task was running. That "
"would be a pretty frustrating experience. Fortunately, your computer’s "
"operating system can, and does, invisibly interrupt the export often enough "
"to let you get other work done simultaneously."

"Now say you’re downloading a video shared by someone else, which can also "
"take a while but does not take up as much CPU time. In this case, the CPU "
"has to wait for data to arrive from the network. While you can start reading "
"the data once it starts to arrive, it might take some time for all of it to "
"show up. Even once the data is all present, if the video is quite large, it "
"could take at least a second or two to load it all. That might not sound "
"like much, but it’s a very long time for a modern processor, which can "
"perform billions of operations every second. Again, your operating system "
"will invisibly interrupt your program to allow the CPU to perform other work "
"while waiting for the network call to finish."

"The video export is an example of a _CPU-bound_ or _compute-bound_ "
"operation. It’s limited by the computer’s potential data processing speed "
"within the CPU or GPU, and how much of that speed it can dedicate to the "
"operation. The video download is an example of an _I/O-bound_ operation, "
"because it’s limited by the speed of the computer’s _input and output_; it "
"can only go as fast as the data can be sent across the network."

"In both of these examples, the operating system’s invisible interrupts "
"provide a form of concurrency. That concurrency happens only at the level of "
"the entire program, though: the operating system interrupts one program to "
"let other programs get work done. In many cases, because we understand our "
"programs at a much more granular level than the operating system does, we "
"can spot opportunities for concurrency that the operating system can’t see."

"For example, if we’re building a tool to manage file downloads, we should be "
"able to write our program so that starting one download won’t lock up the "
"UI, and users should be able to start multiple downloads at the same time. "
"Many operating system APIs for interacting with the network are _blocking_, "
"though; that is, they block the program’s progress until the data they’re "
"processing is completely ready."

"Note: This is how _most_ function calls work, if you think about it. "
"However, the term _blocking_ is usually reserved for function calls that "
"interact with files, the network, or other resources on the computer, "

"the operation being _non_\\-blocking."

"We could avoid blocking our main thread by spawning a dedicated thread to "
"download each file. However, the overhead of the system resources used by "
"those threads would eventually become a problem. It would be preferable if "
"the call didn’t block in the first place, and instead we could define a "
"number of tasks that we’d like our program to complete and allow the runtime "

"When an individual works on several different tasks before any of them is "

"to having two different projects checked out on your computer, and when you "
"get bored or stuck on one project, you switch to the other. You’re just one "
