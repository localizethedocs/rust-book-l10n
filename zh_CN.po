"To improve our program, we’ll fix four problems that have to do with the "
"program’s structure and how it’s handling potential errors. First, our "
"`main` function now performs two tasks: It parses arguments and reads files. "
"As our program grows, the number of separate tasks the `main` function "
"handles will increase. As a function gains responsibilities, it becomes more "
"difficult to reason about, harder to test, and harder to change without "
"breaking one of its parts. It’s best to separate functionality so that each "
"function is responsible for one task."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch12-03-improving-error-handling-and-modularity.md:12
msgid ""
"This issue also ties into the second problem: Although `query` and "
"`file_path` are configuration variables to our program, variables like "
"`contents` are used to perform the program’s logic. The longer `main` "
"becomes, the more variables we’ll need to bring into scope; the more "

"structure to make their purpose clear."

#: src/ch12-03-improving-error-handling-and-modularity.md:19

"The third problem is that we’ve used `expect` to print an error message when "
"reading the file fails, but the error message just prints `Should have been "
"able to read the file`. Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: For "
"example, the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open "

"The Rust programming language has come a long way in a few short years, from "
"its creation and incubation by a small and nascent community of enthusiasts, "
"to becoming one of the most loved and in-demand programming languages in the "
"world. Looking back, it was inevitable that the power and promise of Rust "
"would turn heads and gain a foothold in systems programming. What was not "

"Rust language you see today combines years of research in systems "
"programming with the practical wisdom of a vibrant and passionate community. "

"_Ownership_ is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory. "
"All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while "

"longer-used memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer "
"must explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: "
"Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the "
"compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program won’t "
"compile. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while "
"it’s running."

"Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and "

"whether a value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves "

"described in relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so "
"here is a brief explanation in preparation."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.md:31

"Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to "
"use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores "
"values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite "
"order. This is referred to as _last in, first out (LIFO)_. Think of a stack "
"of plates: When you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and "
"when you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates "
"from the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called "
"_pushing onto the stack_, and removing data is called _popping off the "
"stack_. All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data "
"with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be "
"stored on the heap instead."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.md:43
msgid ""
"The heap is less organized: When you put data on the heap, you request a "
"certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the "
"heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a _pointer_, "
"which is the address of that location. This process is called _allocating on "
"the heap_ and is sometimes abbreviated as just _allocating_ (pushing values "
"onto the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the "
"heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but "
"when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being "
"seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in "
"your group, and the host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads "
"you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve "
"been seated to find you."
msgstr ""

"Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the "
"allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location "
"is always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the "
"heap requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough "
"space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next "
"allocation."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.md:63

"Accessing data in the heap is generally slower than accessing data on the "
"stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary "
"processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the "
"analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. "
"It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to "
"the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, "
"then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower "
"process. By the same token, a processor can usually do its job better if it "
